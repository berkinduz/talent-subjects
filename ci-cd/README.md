# Continuous Integration - Continuous Delivery

- CI/CD is a shortened term for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. CI/CD is the combination of principles, practices, and capabilities that allow for software changes of all kinds to get users in a quick, repeatable, and safe manner. This allows for software developers to integrate their feature or service changes continuously and for IT and operations teams to deliver with the standards, security, and confidence businesses need.

### Continuous Integration 

- CI is an automated process for continually integrating software development changes. CI processes automate the building, testing, and validation of source code.

### Continuous Delivery 

- Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.
