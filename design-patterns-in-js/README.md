# Design pattern in JS

- Factory Pattern : With the factory pattern we can use factory functions in order to create new objects

- Proxy Pattern : With a Proxy object, we get more control over the interactions with certain objects. A proxy object can determine the behavior whenever we're interacting with the object, for example when we're getting a value, or setting a value.

- Observer Pattern : Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
