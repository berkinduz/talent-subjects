# Design pattern in JS

- Factory Pattern : With the factory pattern we can use factory functions in order to create new objects

- Proxy Pattern : With a Proxy object, we get more control over the interactions with certain objects. A proxy object can determine the behavior whenever we're interacting with the object, for example when we're getting a value, or setting a value.

- Observer Pattern : Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.

- Singleton Pattern: Singletons are classes which can be instantiated once, and can be accessed globally. This single instance can be shared throughout our application, which makes Singletons great for managing global state in an application.

- Prototype Pattern: The prototype pattern is a useful way to share properties among many objects of the same type. The prototype is an object that's native to JavaScript, and can be accessed by objects through the prototype chain.

- Decorator Pattern: Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
